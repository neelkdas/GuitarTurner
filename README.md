# GuitarTurner

This code was written for a project awhile back. 

The output of an electric guitar jack feeds into an amplifcation circuit, which feeds into an arduino, which is also connected to a servo motor, which has a 3D printed attachment that fits snugly onto a guitar tuning peg. This code makes the servo turn to tune the string. It automatically detects which string is in tune, and it does not support alternate tunings.

Unfortunately, my mom thought it was trash and threw out the whole thing.
